# Openshift Examples

This repo is the beginnings of a set of materials that will help you consume Openshift. Provided are examples of common objects in YML format, feel free to submit JSON format if you'd prefer via PR.

In most cases the [Openshift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/) should have you covered and should probably always be your first port of call. Sometimes, though, a simple example is all that's needed - that's what is here.
